### _High volume applicant tracking system_

OpenATS is an attempt to create a free, modern, ⚡serverless⚡ implementation of your typical applicant tracking system.

This makes it _almost_ cloud agnostic, but this project will lean heavily on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). At the very basic level, this is what we are trying to build:

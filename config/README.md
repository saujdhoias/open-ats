### Configs

#### THIS IS NOT AN .env FILE!!!

#### YOUR VARIABLES WILL BE EXPOSED!!!

This is a way to set global defaults for certain things such as creating ID's of a specific length, or capping funnel title length, etc. Feel free to use parameter store or whatever you fancy, you can set those up in the serverless.yml file.
